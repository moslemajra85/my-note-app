# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plug-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## My Note App

This is a simple note-taking application built with React and Vite. Users can create notes with a title, category, priority, and description, then save them. The saved notes will be displayed below the input form.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn installed on your system.

-   **Node.js & npm**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Yarn** (Optional): Install via npm: `npm install -g yarn`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project:

    ```bash
    # For Windows, Linux, and macOS users
    # Navigate to your preferred directory, e.g.,
    in-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
    cd ~/Documents/Projects # Or your preferred directory
    git clone https://github.com/moslem-al-mahmood/my-note-app.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate into the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd my-note-app
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    Use either `npm` or `yarn` to install the project's dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

5.  **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```

    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port). Open your web browser and navigate to this address to see your app!

#### üçé For macOS Users

1.  **Open your terminal**: You can find it in `Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` or by searching with Spotlight (`Cmd + Space` and type "Terminal").
